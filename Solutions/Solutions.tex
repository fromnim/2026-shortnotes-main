\section*{maximum boiling aezotrope and deviation}
When we have a max boiling aezotrope we know that it has a lower vapour pressure than its constitutents, this is because for it to reach the boiling point after its constituents it has to reach the vapour pressure of boiling before them. Therefore it is proven to be a case of negative deviation.
