Mouth position: Bite into the harmonica and then take it out until
you reach a position where the inner wet part of your lips is in
contact with the harmonica.. now rotate the harmonica holes to face the 
base of your mouth.. boom!

I am going to spend some time with this lesson.. so i would rather 
revise using the video itself..
